# Profile
profile: |
  The study of science is something I am passionate about. I enjoy looking at scientific problems from different perspectives and angles.
  This drive has always motivated me to learn innovative and diverse expertise so that I can challenge my knowledge.
  The solutions I come up with in my studies usually involve solid mathematics and statistics combined with learning algorithms.  

# Experience
experience:
  - role: Research Assistance
    time: 2020-Present
    company: Carl E. Ravin Advanced Imaging Laboratories (RAI Labs)
    details: |
      As a member of the Center of Virtual Imaging Trials (CVIT), I aim to optimize the quality of medical images through virtual acquisition.
      Virtual patients and scanners enable us to collect a sufficient number of training datasets and target references.
      Furthermore, virtual data is used for technical development of new algorithms without compromising the privacy or well-being of patients. 
      My work in CVIT focused on optimizing the protocol selection guidelines to improve radiologist evaluation of images.
      I developed physics-informed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reduce variability in images acquired by different centers/systems that are influenced by
      scanning processes.

  - role: Researcher
    time: 2018-2020
    company: Cyber Physical Security Lab (CPSL)
    details: |
      A safety-critical system, such as an autonomous vehicle or medical device, directly affects human life quality. 
      Today, these systems are equipped with a variety of technologies, and each component has a significant impact on the final outcome and safety.
      My research involves the development of stochastic model-checking algorithms for learning-enabled CPL systems such as robots, vehicles, and power systems.
      The developed algorithms indicate whether a complex system is capable of satisfying a set of desired specifications or not. 
    technologies_used: | 
      Python, Matlab, Webots, Gazebo, ROS
      
  - role: Researcher
    time: 2014-2018
    company: Human and Robot Interation Lab (TaarLab)
    details: |
      Controlling autonomous vehicles requires a combination of human and intelligence units. Thus, such systems face a number of challenges, including
      controlling the mobile device smoothly, avoiding obstacles in dynamic environments, and combining sensory data so that the most useful and informative
      information is used to make a proper decision. For my master's thesis, I developed several obstacle avoidance algorithms and developed a design criteria
      to synthesize the anti-oscillation controllers. Additionally, designing real-world robots and working with real commercial robots helps me to develop data
      fusion algorithms that preprocess sensory data and use them for more accurate system feedback.

# Volunteering
volunteering:
  - time: 2019-2022
    role: President/Vic-President/Treasurer
    company: Graduate Student Association of Iranians at Duke
    details: |
      The board member's responsibilities included introducing Iranian culture, art, and literature to other Duke University communities.
      In addition, the board member provided a supportive environment for Iranian students at Duke University to reflect on their needs,
      comments, and achievements in their new environment. During the last three years, we have hosted over 60 different events, which was
      impossible for a small community like ours without the support and passion of members and officers at Duke.
