# Profile
profile: |
  The study of science is something I am passionate about. I enjoy looking at scientific problems from different perspectives and angles.
  This drive has always motivated me to learn innovative and diverse expertise so that I can challenge my knowledge.
  The solutions I come up with in my studies usually involve solid mathematics and statistics combined with learning algorithms.  

# Experience

  - role: Research Assistance
    time: 2020-Present
    company: Carl E. Ravin Advanced Imaging Laboratories (RAI Labs)
    details: |
    As a member of the Center of Virtual Imaging Trials (CVIT), I aim to optimize the quality of medical images through virtual acquisition.
    Virtual patients and scanners enable us to collect a sufficient number of training datasets and target references.
    Furthermore, virtual data is used for technical development of new algorithms without compromising the privacy or well-being of patients. 
    My work in CVIT focused on optimizing the protocol selection guidelines to improve radiologist evaluation of images.
    I developed physics-informed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reduce variability in images acquired by different centers/systems that are influenced by
    scanning processes. 
    #To conduce a successful assesment or diagnoistic imaging procedure different components play their important role. The patients registration,
    #employed system to perform the imaging, the adopted protocols to be set for the imaging systems, and post processing and measurment metrics radiologist use
    #to evaluate the obtained images have their significant impact on the final results and desicion. 
    #Optimizing the medical images can be carried out in 1) prospective and 2) retrospective way. The first

  - role: Researcher
    time: 2018-2020
    company: Cyber Physical Security Lab (CPSL)
    details: |
      A safety-critical system, such as an autonomous vehicle or medical device, directly affects human life quality. 
      Today, these systems are equipped with a variety of technologies, and each component has a significant impact on the final outcome and safety.
      My research involves the development of stochastic model-checking algorithms for learning-enabled CPL systems such as robots, vehicles, and power systems.
      The developed algorithms indicate whether a complex system is capable of satisfying a set of desired specifications or not.
