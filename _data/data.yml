# Profile
profile: |
  Science is a subject that deeply fascinates me. I take pleasure in exploring scientific dilemmas from various viewpoints and approaches.
  My passion fuels my eagerness to acquire unconventional and multifarious skills, which enables me to broaden my understanding
  My research methodologies typically involve robust mathematical and statistical techniques, complemented by advanced learning algorithms to produce effective solutions.

# Experience
experience:
  - role: Research Assistance
    time: 2020-Present
    company: Carl E. Ravin Advanced Imaging Laboratories (RAI Labs)
    details: |
      As a member of the Center of Virtual Imaging Trials (CVIT), my goal is to enhance the quality of medical images through virtual acquisition.
      By utilizing virtual patients and scanners, we can gather enough training datasets and target references without jeopardizing patient privacy or well-being. 
      At CVIT, I concentrate on refining the protocol selection guidelines to improve radiologist image evaluation.
      I have also created physics-informed Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to minimize image variability caused by scanning processes from various centers/systems. 
      Additionally, I've developed automated pipelines that extract relevant biomarkers to enable precise and reliable quantification of medical images.
    technologies_used: | 
      Machine Learning, Polynomial Optimization, Deep Learning, Data Science, Python, Pytorch, Yalmip, Gorubi, Matlab
  
  - role: Researcher
    time: 2018-2020
    company: Cyber Physical Security Lab (CPSL)
    details: |
      I focus on the importance of safety-critical systems, such as medical devices or autonomous vehicles, as they directly impact human well-being.
      With the ever-evolving technologies embedded in these systems, each component plays a crucial role in ensuring the final outcome is safe and reliable.
      Through my research, I specialize in creating stochastic model-checking algorithms specifically designed for learning-enabled systems like robots, vehicles, and power systems.
      These algorithms assess whether a complex system can meet the desired specifications and rely on a unique stochastic model checking approach to gauge the system's reliability within a given confidence interval.
    technologies_used: | 
      Python, Matlab, Webots, Gazebo, ROS
      
  - role: Researcher
    time: 2014-2018
    company: Human and Robot Interation Lab (TaarLab)
    details: |
      Controlling autonomous vehicles requires a combination of human and intelligence units. Thus, such systems face a number of challenges, including
      controlling the mobile device smoothly, avoiding obstacles in dynamic environments, and combining sensory data so that the most useful and informative
      information is used to make a proper decision. For my master's thesis, I developed several obstacle avoidance algorithms and developed a design criteria
      to synthesize the anti-oscillation controllers. Additionally, designing real-world robots and working with real commercial robots helps me to develop data
      fusion algorithms that preprocess sensory data and use them for more accurate system feedback.
    technologies_used: | 
      Matlab, Gazebo, ROS, C++, Gorubi

    role: President/Vice-President/Treasurer
    company: Graduate Student Association of Iranians at Duke
    details: |
      The board member's responsibilities included introducing Iranian culture, art, and literature to other Duke University communities.
      In addition, the board member provided a supportive environment for Iranian students at Duke University to reflect on their needs,
      comments, and achievements in their new environment. During the last three years, we have hosted over 60 different events, which was
      impossible for a small community like ours without the support and passion of members and officers at Duke.
